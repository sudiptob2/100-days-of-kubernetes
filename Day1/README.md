## Day 1 activity

Today I am just starting off :kneeling_person:

- [x] Setup Minikube
- [x] Started [kubernetes-for-the-absolute-beginners](https://kodekloud.com/courses/kubernetes-for-the-absolute-beginners-hands-on/) @ **KodeCloud**
- [x] Setup a example cluster
- [x] Created a simple `yml` definition file.

Basically, I understood what `kubernetes` does form a high level. I created a simple **kubernetes** cluster by following the **kodecloud course** and the **kubernetes** documentation. To be honest I did not understood all the commands I ran.
